# AGENTS.md — unotes

A web application in Mojo on the `m0` framework: one compiled binary, no
Python at run time. This page is the rules that are not obvious from the
code. The framework's own source is installed and readable — `uv run m0
include` prints where. Grep it before guessing an API.

## Commands

Always `uv run m0 …` (the project's own venv; `uvx` is for `m0 new` alone).

| command | what it does | time |
|---|---|---|
| `uv run m0 test` | runs `test/test_*.mojo`; no link, no server | 2–4 s |
| `uv run m0 build` | compiles `src/server.mojo` to `bin/server` | 10–13 s after an edit |
| `uv run m0 dev` | builds, serves, and rebuilds when `src/` or `pyproject.toml` changes; the old server keeps serving until a build SUCCEEDS, so a syntax error costs a compiler message and not the page; `-- --port 8080` goes to the binary | a build per save |
| `uv run m0 doctor` | every toolchain check, then the binary's resolved configuration, then which of the files `m0 new` wrote differ from what this `m0` writes; `--json` for a machine | < 1 s |
| `uv run m0 build --release` | a relocatable `dist/` for the baseline CPU | a build, plus the bundling |
| `uv run m0 image` | `docker build -f deploy/Dockerfile`, then the image's own `about.json`; needs docker and a committed `uv.lock`, and no local toolchain | minutes the first time |
| `./smoke.sh` | build, serve on its own port, probe the wire, stop | a build, plus a second |

The test loop is three to five times faster than the build loop. **Put logic in
functions a test can reach** — a renderer that takes values, a state struct
with methods — and keep views thin. A test is also the only thing that
vouches for a function nothing calls yet: in an imported module the compiler
does not diagnose one, malformed signature included, so a green build says
nothing about it. `bin/server --port 8080` runs the app;
`--doctor` prints its configuration and starts nothing.

Every refusal, from `m0` and from the binary, is exit **78** and one line
naming the fix. Exit 1 is the compiler's or a test's own failure; exit 2 is
a command line that cannot be read. Read the line; do not retry.

## Layout

`src/server.mojo` is `main` and imports its siblings by bare name (`from
views import …`); tests reach them the same way. There is no
`__init__.mojo` and no package named for the app. Tests are `test_*`
functions in `test/test_*.mojo`; adding one needs no registration.

## Views

- A view is a free function `(req, params, state) raises -> HTTPResponse`.
  `add_read` hands it the state borrowed, `add_write` hands it `mut`,
  `add_loop` registers a stateless view answered on the event loop.
- **No middleware, no decorators**: a stored view is a `thin` function
  pointer and a closure is not one. A guard is an early return of
  `Optional[HTTPResponse]` on the view's first lines.
- Routes are `comptime` patterns given to the table AND to `url_for`, so a
  misspelled route is a compile error. Never build a path by hand, and
  never a query string: `Query().add(name, value)` then `q.on(url_for(X))`
  encodes both halves, request data included.
- State that lives in one process answers `max_workers() -> 1`, and
  `M0_WORKERS=2` is then refused rather than served as two different
  copies. Move the state out (a database, the shared page) before raising it.
- `form(req)` is `None` unless the body is a urlencoded form. Check it.
- `read_signals(req)` is Datastar's signal store as JSON text: the query on
  GET and DELETE, the body otherwise. An action sent with `{contentType:
  'form'}` carries no signals: read it with `form(req)`. The Datastar frame
  builders raise on a line break in a selector, mode or event id.

## Rendering

- `Fragment[V]("id")` writes the root id once; `f.el(tag, verb, url, …)`
  and `f.swap(verb, url)` generate the attributes that target it. **Never
  type an `hx-*` or `data-on:*` swap attribute by hand**, and never retype
  the id as `#id`.
- A swap that arrives at a VIEW — a filtered list, a detail — takes
  `push=True`, so the address bar follows and the view can be reloaded and
  linked to. A `get` only; `Fragment[Datastar]` refuses it (Datastar has no
  history handling), so a view that needs an address there is a plain link.
- Escaping is named at every hole: `text(x)` for data in an element,
  `attr(name, x)` for data in an attribute (it owns the quotes), `raw`/a
  bare string only for markup this code wrote. Request data in a bare
  string is an injection.
- `page_or_fragment(req, fragment, Shell(...))` decides document-or-fragment
  from the request's headers and sets `Vary`. No view branches on a header.
- **htmx 4 swaps every answer, 4xx included.** An error a person may see is
  the fragment with the message in it and the right status
  (`status=422`); `reply.problem` is for routes no browser swaps.
- Moving a `Fragment[Htmx]` app to Datastar is `Fragment[Datastar]` and the
  script tag. A Datastar URL sits inside a JavaScript string: build it with
  `url_for`, which encodes; a URL carrying `'`, `\`, CR or LF is refused.

## A login

`--template auth` has one: the list behind a signed session, every write
carrying a CSRF token. `m0_http.login` is the glue it is written on, and
what a `views` or `live` application adds the day it needs one.

- `Login.from_env("APP", "NAME-session")` reads `APP_KEY` (at least 32
  bytes), `APP_PASSWORD` and `APP_SECURE`, and raises naming what is
  missing. Read it in `main` BEFORE `serve` and exit 78 on the error, so
  `--doctor` refuses what the run would; read it again in `make`.
- **`APP_SECURE` is stated, never assumed**: `1` wherever the app is
  served over HTTPS, so the session cookie carries `Secure` --
  `deploy/fly.toml` says so -- and `0` over plain http such as
  `http://localhost`, where a browser need not keep a `Secure` cookie at
  all. Never put it in the image: a platform that says nothing is then
  refused rather than served in clear.
- A view behind it opens with two lines: `var session =
  st.login.session_of(req)`, then, without one, `return
  refuse_signed_out(req, LOGIN, render_login(...))` -- a 303 for a
  navigation, a 401 carrying the form for a swap.
- **Every write needs the session's CSRF token**, checked on the view's
  next line by `csrf_refusal(req, form(req), session, url)`: a POST carries
  it as a hidden field (`csrf_input(token)`), a DELETE as a header
  (`header=csrf_header(token)` on its swap), because htmx 4 puts a DELETE's
  fields in the query string and a token in a URL is a token in every log.
  `Fragment[Datastar]` refuses a header: a Datastar write carries its token
  in a field.
- **Login and logout are PLAIN forms** (`el("form", attr("method", "post")
  + attr("action", url))`), answered with a 303 — never `f.el("form", …)`.
  A swap changes the fragment and not the address bar, so signing in
  leaves the application under `/login` and signing out leaves the login
  form under whatever was open. `sign_in(user, password)` is the
  credential check and the session in one call.
- Every answer the session chose is `no_store(...)`: `Vary` names the
  fragment headers, not the cookie, and a cache in front would otherwise
  hand one visitor's page to another.
- **A hand-built request parses no `Cookie` header**; only the server's
  parser fills `req.cookies`. A test of a view behind a session fills the
  jar itself: `var jar = RequestCookieJar()` (from `lightbug_http.cookie`),
  `jar.add_pairs("name=value")`, then `HTTPRequest(uri, headers=…,
  cookies=jar^)`. Without it every such test is answered as signed out.
  The `auth` template's test signs in through the table and does this.
- One user, its secret in the environment: no user table, no password
  hashing, no session store. A session ends at its expiry, or when its key
  leaves the ring (`APP_KEY_PREV` keeps the old key through a rotation).

## Streaming (SSE)

- Opening a stream is an `add_write` view: it subscribes a connection slot.
- A stream registry's capacity must be at least the server's connection
  count (`ctx.capacity`): slots index it directly.
- **Every frame is the full state, never a delta.** A slow viewer's 64 KB
  outbox DROPS frames, it does not queue them; a dropped full frame is
  healed by the next one.
- Work on a cadence goes in a `Producer` (`step` returns the nanoseconds to
  the next step), never in the loop's `tick`, which stalls every
  connection. Number frames with `out.next_id()`, and COUNT a publish that
  returns `False`: a refused frame is otherwise invisible.
- What workers and the producer share crosses a process boundary: it lives
  on the `page_slots` shared page, never in `malloc`'d memory.

## Storage

- `m0_sqlite` and `m0_postgres` ship with the framework and link NOTHING:
  each opens its C library at run time (`libsqlite3`, `libpq`), so `m0
  build` takes no flag and `m0 test` can open a database. The library
  must be on the machine: `libsqlite3-0` is in the image already and
  `libpq5` is one build argument away (`deploy/README.md`);
  `M0_LIBSQLITE3` and `M0_LIBPQ` name a file outright.
- **A connection belongs to one thread, opened where that thread runs**:
  a handler's `make` (once per worker, loop or pool thread), a producer's
  first `step`. Never before the fork, never shared across threads.
  `open(path)` puts the file in WAL mode and refuses a target that cannot
  be (`:memory:`); `open_memory()` is for tests.
- **A value that must survive a restart is written in the request that
  changes it**, so the answer the client sees is a committed row. A
  producer that writes state back on its poll loses whatever landed
  between its last poll and SIGTERM; `live` lost a kick that way on CI.
- Two workers over one file are fine under WAL. A mutation that then
  BROADCASTS holds the write lock (`db.begin_immediate()` … `db.commit()`)
  from its change until its frame is numbered, or a stale render can take
  the newer id and every tab shows the older list.
- `M0_DB` names the file; the image points it at `/app/data`, the one
  directory the container may write, and a deploy keeps it only on a
  volume mounted there. The `live` template's `store.mojo` is the worked
  example.

## Mojo traps this framework has paid for

- A `String` that came from a request may not be UTF-8. **Never slice one
  with `s[byte=a:b]`** — it traps on a non-boundary byte and takes the
  server down. Use `String(unsafe_from_utf8=s.as_bytes()[a:b])`.
- A pointer handed to C does not keep its buffer alive. After an FFI call
  that reads through `x.unsafe_ptr()`, write a bare `_ = x`. Deleting that
  line is a use-after-free with no symptom at the call site.
- `from std.…` imports; `comptime` for constants; `s.as_bytes()[i]`, not
  `s[i]`; write `__init__` explicitly.

## Configuration the host reads

Flag > environment > default; `bin/server --doctor` prints the result.
`M0_HOST`, `M0_PORT`, `M0_BASE_URL`, `M0_WORKERS` (processes),
`M0_THREADS` (loops in one process; not beside `M0_WORKERS>1`),
`M0_BLOCKING_THREADS` (handler threads per loop), `M0_SPAWN_WORKERS`
(refused), `M0_ACCESS_LOG`, `M0_SSE_HEARTBEAT_MS`, `M0_APP_TICK_MS`,
`M0_MAX_KEEPALIVE_REQUESTS`, `M0_QOS`. A count that cannot be
served is a 78 whichever way it arrived. More than one core is
`M0_THREADS=N`; `M0_WORKERS` forks, and is refused when the binary links
MAX's parallel runtime (`max.algorithm.parallelize`), whose threads a
fork does not copy.

## Probing a running server

One port per run, never a shared one; wait for `/health` before the first
probe; stop the server **by pid**, never by name; take the exit status from
the probe, not from the last command of a pipe. `smoke.sh` does all four.

## MAX, if a step needs every core

- Optional, and pinned beside mojo: `uv add --dev 'max-core==X'` with the
  X `m0 doctor`'s `max-gated` line names (`pyproject.toml` has it in a
  comment). Any other version is refused: `max-core` pins its own
  `mojo-compiler` exactly, so a second version is a second toolchain.
- `parallelize` is `from max.algorithm import parallelize`, and its
  closure needs a capture list: `def work(i: Int) {var out} -> None:`.
- Where it belongs: a producer's `step`, or a heavy view that is rarely
  busy twice at once. Never a hot route: under load it adds nothing (the
  cores are already busy with other requests) and alone it pays the spread.
- A binary that links it is served as loops on threads (`M0_THREADS`), and
  `M0_WORKERS` above 1 is refused (78): a forked worker never returns from
  `parallelize`, because `fork()` copies one thread and the runtime's
  workers were started before `main`. On macOS this holds for every
  binary built while `max-core` is installed, whether or not it imports
  MAX -- the toolchain links the runtime regardless -- so there
  `M0_THREADS` is the way to N cores for any app in a MAX venv.
- `uv run m0 build --release` bundles its runtime library
  (`libAsyncRTMojoBindings`) beside the binary with the rest, so the image
  needs nothing more.

## Upgrading m0

Take the newer `m0` (`uv add --dev 'm0==X'`), then run `uv run m0 doctor`.
Its `mojo-gated` line names the ONE `uv add` that moves the rest of the
toolchain — `mojo`, and `max-core` beside it when it is installed, since
`max-core` pins its own compiler exactly and moving `mojo` alone cannot
resolve. Nothing rewrites this project's files: the doctor's `scaffold`
line names those `m0 new` wrote — the deploy files, the ignore files, the
workflow, this page — that differ from what the new `m0` writes, whether
you edited them or an older `m0` wrote them. `uv run m0 new /tmp/NAME`
writes the new ones beside yours; carry over what you want by hand.

## Not built, on purpose

No template engine, middleware, ORM, multipart parsing, session store or
password hashing. Documentation: https://m0serve.dev/mojo/ (the host, views
and fragments, deploy), and https://m0serve.dev/llms.txt for an agent.
