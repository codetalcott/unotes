# Deploying unotes

The image holds the binary, the Mojo runtime libraries beside it, and no
Python. Everything here runs from the PROJECT ROOT, which is the build
context.

## The image

```sh
uv sync                                         # once; commit uv.lock
uv run m0 image                                 # docker build -f deploy/Dockerfile -t unotes .
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 unotes
```

The builder stage runs `uv run m0 build --release`: the platform's baseline
CPU, never the builder's own. `/app/about.json` in the image is what the
image measured about itself (its size, and that no interpreter is in it);
`m0 image` prints it last. `--tag T` names the image, `--target-cpu CPU`
compiles for something newer than the baseline, and whatever follows a bare
`--` goes to `docker build` as it is (`-- --platform linux/amd64`). `m0
image` needs docker and nothing else: the compiler runs in the builder.

## Fly.io

```sh
fly apps create unotes
fly deploy -c deploy/fly.toml --remote-only
fly scale count 1 -a unotes
```

- `--remote-only`: an image built on an Apple Silicon laptop is built under
  emulation for Fly's x86-64 machines, and the Mojo compiler does not
  survive that.
- `scale count 1`: the first deploy creates two machines. State held in
  the process is one machine's; see the comment in `fly.toml`.
- One loop. On one shared vCPU a second worker or thread cannot run beside
  the first, so `M0_WORKERS`/`M0_THREADS` stay unset.
